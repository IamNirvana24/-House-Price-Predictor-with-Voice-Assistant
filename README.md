🏠 House Price Predictor with Voice Assistant 🎙️📊
Ever wondered how much a house might cost based on its area, number of bedrooms, and age?
This mini project uses Supervised Machine Learning (Linear Regression) to predict house prices, and then speaks the result aloud using a text-to-speech engine!

🚀 Features
Trained on basic housing data

Input: Area (in sq. ft), Number of Bedrooms, and Age (in years)

Output: Predicted House Price (in Lakhs)

Voice-enabled output using pyttsx3

Beginner-friendly and easy to understand!

🧰 Built With
Python

scikit-learn

pyttsx3 (for speech output)

🎯 What This Project Teaches
Basics of Linear Regression (Supervised ML)

How to use a trained model to make predictions

Integrating machine learning with voice output

Building practical ML projects that feel alive!

📢 Example Use Case
You enter the house details — say, 1232 sq. ft., 2 bedrooms, 20 years old.
It calculates the expected price and speaks:

"The predicted cost which I can tell you for this Area, Bedrooms and Age is 59.35 lakhs."

Pretty cool, right? 😎

📌 How to Run
